Cellular Automata Software

Cellular Automata is a system of 'cells' where each 'cell' has a rules that effect what will happen to it on each turn!
Conway's game of life is a fantastic and very famous example.

This software was a testiment to many design patterns I have learned. It can be used to create and manage complex rules for Cellular Automata, with each rule being comprised of tiny working parts that can be tweeked and altered.
Admittedly the UI is a bit tough to understand, but that wasn't the focus of the project. Check out the instructions and the totorial!
